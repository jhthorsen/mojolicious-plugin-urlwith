NAME
    Mojolicious::Plugin::UrlWith - Preserve parts of the url

VERSION
    0.05

DESCRIPTION
    This helper provides the same method as "url_for" in
    Mojolicious::Controller with the difference that it keeps the query
    string.

SYNOPSIS
        package MyApp;
        sub startup {
            my $self = shift;

            $self->plugin('Mojolicious::Plugin::UrlWith' => {
                parse_fragment => 1,
                current_page_class => 'current-page',
            });

            # ...
        }

ATTRIBUTES
  parse_fragment
    Will remove the '#fragment' part from the first arugment to "url_with",
    and use it use it for "fragment" in Mojo::URL.

  current_page_class
        $self->current_page_class($classname);
        $classname = $self->current_page_class;

    Will add the $classname to the link in "link_with" if the path part of
    the link match the currently requested path. You need to set this
    attribute when registering the plugin, since the default value is empty
    string, cancelling the behavior.

    This attribute is EXPERIMENTAL and may be removed/changed without
    warning.

HELPERS
  url_with
    The examples below has this current request url:
    "http://somedomain.com/search?page=1".

    $controller->url_with({ name => 'bob' });
        Will result in "http://somedomain.com/search?page=1&name=bob".

    $controller->url_with({ page => undef });
        Will result in "http://somedomain.com/search".

    $controller->url_with('named', { age => 42 });
        Will result in
        "http://somedomain.com/some/named/route?page=1&age=42".

    $controller->url_with('/path', { random => 24 });
        Will result in "http://somedomain.com/path?page=1&random=24".

    $controller->url_with('/path', [ c => 313 ]);
        Will result in "http://somedomain.com/path?c=313".

    Summary: A hash-ref will be merged with existing query params, while an
    array-ref will create a new set of query params.

  link_with
    Same as "link_to" in Mojolicious::Plugin::TagHelpers, but use "url_with"
    instead of "url_to" in Mojolicious::Controller to construct the hyper
    reference.

METHODS
  register
    Will register the methods under "HELPERS".
